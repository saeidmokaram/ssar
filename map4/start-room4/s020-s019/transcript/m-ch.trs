<Sync time="28.31"/>

<Sync time="28.62"/>

<Sync time="29.65"/>

<Sync time="32.14"/>
going through the left hand side of the three doors
<Sync time="34.8"/>

<Sync time="35.75"/>
we move into
<Sync time="37.36"/>

<Sync time="37.59"/>
a dining room
<Sync time="38.83"/>

<Sync time="39.51"/>
the dining room has | two tables
<Sync time="42.36"/>

<Sync time="42.99"/>
one big and one small
<Sync time="44.6"/>

<Sync time="44.96"/>
the bigger table has six chairs at it and the small one has four chairs | they appear to be set for dinner
<Sync time="51.94"/>

<Sync time="53.39"/>
there is also a an ornate lamp on the ceiling | and a clock on one wall
<Sync time="59.12"/>

<Sync time="60.28"/>
the dining room
<Sync time="61.78"/>

<Sync time="62.05"/>
has two other doors leading off it
<Sync time="64.71"/>

<Sync time="65.46"/>
going through the left hand of those two doors
<Sync time="67.698"/>

<Sync time="68.43"/>
we go into the living room | and the living room has in it
<Sync time="72.38"/>

<Sync time="72.61"/>
three sofas
<Sync time="74.24"/>

<Sync time="74.5"/>
it's got a rug on the floor and a ceiling fan
<Sync time="78.1"/>

<Sync time="78.44"/>
er it's also got | a television
<Sync time="81.53"/>

<Sync time="81.98"/>
um | sitting on a cabinet | with a few electronical devices in the cabinet
<Sync time="87.8"/>

<Sync time="88.37"/>
um | this living room has three doors leading off of it
<Sync time="93.38"/>

<Sync time="94.27"/>
going through the left hand | oh sorry not including the one we've just three other doors lead off from it
<Sync time="99.82"/>

<Sync time="100.32"/>
going through left hand of these three doors
<Sync time="103.0"/>

<Sync time="104.54"/>
we find ourselves in a bedroom
<Sync time="106.62"/>

<Sync time="107.44"/>
it's got a double bed in it with | two bedside tables | the double bed has a tray balanced upon it
<Sync time="114.77"/>

<Sync time="115.42"/>

<Sync time="133.96"/>

<Sync time="139.79"/>

<Sync time="140.0"/>
which I will now go through
<Sync time="141.61"/>

<Sync time="143.37"/>
and this door has led us back once again into the bathroom in which we started
<Sync time="149.32"/>

<Sync time="150.78"/>
so to confirm | the bathroom leads
<Sync time="154.3"/>

<Sync time="154.9"/>
from the left hand most door into a bedroom
<Sync time="158.14"/>

<Sync time="158.43"/>
and then that bedroom leads
<Sync time="160.51"/>

<Sync time="161.55"/>
into a living room
<Sync time="163.06"/>

<Sync time="163.6"/>
and then
<Sync time="164.77"/>

<Sync time="165.38"/>
the right hand door of that living room | leads into a dining room
<Sync time="169.18"/>

<Sync time="169.35"/>
and the right hand side door of that dining room | leads into the initial bathroom
<Sync time="173.96"/>

<Sync time="174.59"/>
so i'm now in the dining room
<Sync time="176.83"/>

<Sync time="178.4"/>
and
<Sync time="179.57"/>

<Sync time="180.79"/>
# and it er | gone a bit slow
<Sync time="183.67"/>

<Sync time="184.96"/>

<Sync time="197.01"/>

<Sync time="198.06"/>
and this leads us into
<Sync time="200.65"/>

<Sync time="200.94"/>
the kitchen % which has a radiator in it and it's also got | a fridge
<Sync time="206.63"/>

<Sync time="207.33"/>
and it's got two work surfaces one of which has a fridge in it | the other of which | has a hob on it
<Sync time="215.15"/>

<Sync time="215.63"/>
and | there are two ovens | and some drawers

<Sync time="221.71"/>
# okay and | this room also has one other door leading away from it
<Sync time="226.25"/>

<Sync time="226.69"/>
on the left hand side
<Sync time="229.12"/>

<Sync time="231.13"/>

<Sync time="400.71"/>
one of these doors leads us to the bedroom | which we've just visited
<Sync time="405.27"/>
