<Sync time="213.36"/>

<Sync time="214.41"/>
five work benches wooden work benches | with tools on them

<Sync time="220.1"/>
and then there's a machine in the corner | which has caught fire
<Sync time="224.15"/>

<Sync time="228.52"/>
and from this room there is one other door
<Sync time="231.62"/>

<Sync time="233.26"/>
which is on the left hand wall
<Sync time="234.97"/>

<Sync time="235.4"/>
er from the direction that i've just entered
<Sync time="237.46"/>

<Sync time="238.97"/>
so i'm gonna go through that door
<Sync time="240.75"/>

<Sync time="242.22"/>
and i'm into a kitchen
<Sync time="243.93"/>

<Sync time="245.71"/>
er and the kitchen's got
<Sync time="247.94"/>

<Sync time="249.01"/>
er cupboards and an oven in the corner
<Sync time="251.53"/>

<Sync time="252.34"/>

<Sync time="260.46"/>
and then a light | and there's a lot smoke in this room
<Sync time="263.35"/>

<Sync time="265.46"/>
and then this room's got one other door
<Sync time="267.62"/>

<Sync time="269.15"/>
and i'll just try and work out the direction | so from the door i've just come in
<Sync time="272.85"/>

<Sync time="273.31"/>
that door is off to the left
<Sync time="275.44"/>

<Sync time="275.76"/>
and that connects back to the living room with the

<Sync time="282.98"/>

<Sync time="284.69"/>

<Sync time="288.535"/>

<Sync time="288.946"/>
through
<Sync time="289.94"/>

<Sync time="290.16"/>
to the classroom with the two computers
<Sync time="293.59"/>

<Sync time="295.35"/>

<Sync time="304.93"/>

<Sync time="305.26"/>

<Sync time="316.47"/>

<Sync time="317.53"/>

<Sync time="320.02"/>

<Sync time="320.5"/>
left to the games room
<Sync time="322.77"/>

<Sync time="324.9"/>
from that right
<Sync time="326.62"/>

<Sync time="329.0"/>
er through to a bathroom
<Sync time="330.69"/>

<Sync time="333.03"/>
right again

<Sync time="335.45"/>
through to | er the big blue bedroom | and then the right wall again
<Sync time="339.85"/>

<Sync time="341.22"/>

<Sync time="351.94"/>

<Sync time="352.48"/>

<Sync time="356.31"/>

<Sync time="357.39"/>
