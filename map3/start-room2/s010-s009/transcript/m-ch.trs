<Sync time="1.4"/>
i'm in a_ | bathroom which looks remarkably similar to the other one
<Sync time="6.22"/>

<Sync time="6.48"/>
so a radiator
<Sync time="8.51"/>

<Sync time="8.95"/>
a hoover
<Sync time="10.24"/>

<Sync time="11.03"/>
a_ | washing machine | a drying rack
<Sync time="14.81"/>

<Sync time="15.26"/>

<Sync time="19.2"/>

<Sync time="20.17"/>

<Sync time="21.5"/>

<Sync time="21.92"/>
something to hang your towels from
<Sync time="23.74"/>

<Sync time="23.96"/>
a mirror and a cabinet with a sink in it
<Sync time="27.23"/>

<Sync time="29.74"/>
and there's two doors
<Sync time="31.28"/>

<Sync time="31.58"/>
i'll go take a left
<Sync time="33.6"/>

<Sync time="34.38"/>
into a_ bedroom
<Sync time="35.93"/>

<Sync time="36.77"/>
which has a double bed
<Sync time="39.11"/>

<Sync time="39.64"/>
and a_
<Sync time="41.47"/>

<Sync time="41.85"/>
big wardrobe with clothes in it
<Sync time="43.87"/>

<Sync time="44.43"/>
and that's everything in there | so there's two doors there's one new one which i'm going through
<Sync time="49.06"/>

<Sync time="49.86"/>
into a | sort of study
<Sync time="52.94"/>

<Sync time="53.68"/>
there's two big desks each one has a chair and a computer
<Sync time="58.48"/>

<Sync time="60.02"/>
and one of them has a printer
<Sync time="62.1"/>

<Sync time="63.19"/>
there's also a whiteboard on the wall
<Sync time="65.51"/>

<Sync time="67.3"/>
and there's three doors in total
<Sync time="69.22"/>

<Sync time="69.53"/>
so I take a right | and go back that way
<Sync time="72.54"/>

<Sync time="74.39"/>
we have a_ | a games room
<Sync time="76.7"/>

<Sync time="77.46"/>
with a | pool table
<Sync time="80.18"/>

<Sync time="80.78"/>
table tennis table

<Sync time="83.05"/>
a_ | treadmill
<Sync time="85.43"/>

<Sync time="85.7"/>
a radiator and a | cycling machine
<Sync time="89.75"/>
 
<Sync time="94.24"/>
oh I jumped on the table okay | there's one new door which takes me back into the bathroom
<Sync time="100.32"/>

<Sync time="101.39"/>
so there's two doors in the games room
<Sync time="103.31"/>

<Sync time="103.57"/>
so i'm gonna go back through the games room | into
<Sync time="106.59"/>

<Sync time="106.93"/>
the study | thing and then into the new door
<Sync time="111.4"/>

<Sync time="112.16"/>
which is a_ living room
<Sync time="114.06"/>

<Sync time="115.45"/>
erm | it's got | a chair
<Sync time="119.15"/>

<Sync time="120.23"/>
er another chair which is a bit different to the first one | it's like an egg chair
<Sync time="124.14"/>

<Sync time="124.25"/>
and then
<Sync time="125.45"/>

<Sync time="125.6"/>
er a sofa | two sofas sorry
<Sync time="128.82"/>

<Sync time="129.03"/>
one with two seats one with three
<Sync time="130.97"/>

<Sync time="131.95"/>
there's a grandfather clock
<Sync time="133.6"/>

<Sync time="134.35"/>
a record player
<Sync time="136.12"/>

<Sync time="136.81"/>
a piano with a stool
<Sync time="138.87"/>

<Sync time="139.46"/>
er a moving ceiling fan
<Sync time="141.77"/>

<Sync time="141.9"/>
and a rug on the floor
<Sync time="143.65"/>

<Sync time="146.56"/>
and that's three doors in total
<Sync time="148.54"/>

<Sync time="149.46"/>
i'm gonna take the left hand one
<Sync time="151.54"/>

<Sync time="154.62"/>
into a din- er | sort of kitchen diner
<Sync time="157.62"/>

<Sync time="158.62"/>
so in the corner there's a
<Sync time="161.19"/>

<Sync time="162.18"/>
there's cabinets with a_ sink and | a hob on it
<Sync time="166.17"/>

<Sync time="166.95"/>
and there's also a_ | microwave oven or something built into it
<Sync time="171.49"/>

<Sync time="172.79"/>
and some more cupboards above it and below it 
<Sync time="175.37"/>

<Sync time="175.96"/>
and there's a | big fridge | separate to that
<Sync time="180.08"/>

<Sync time="180.83"/>
two big fridges separate to that
<Sync time="182.67"/>

<Sync time="183.25"/>
and in the middle of the room there's a_ | dining room table
<Sync time="186.52"/>

<Sync time="186.98"/>
with six chairs
<Sync time="188.75"/>

<Sync time="188.88"/>
a chandelier
<Sync time="190.16"/>

<Sync time="191.34"/>
and in the corner there's like a | there's another cooker with | six rings on
<Sync time="195.42"/>

<Sync time="195.66"/>
and an oven below it or something like that
<Sync time="197.84"/>

<Sync time="199.07"/>
so I go through the new door so there's two doors in total
<Sync time="202.18"/>

<Sync time="202.92"/>
and I can see a fire
<Sync time="204.46"/>

<Sync time="207.79"/>
it's a workshop room
<Sync time="209.63"/>

<Sync time="210.47"/>
which is a bit slow to move
<Sync time="212.07"/>

<Sync time="213.54"/>
if I find a good spot to look at it from 
<Sync time="215.68"/>

<Sync time="216.14"/>
so the fire's in the back corner | which is engulfing
<Sync time="219.66"/>

<Sync time="219.86"/>
cabinets of some sort
<Sync time="222.02"/>

<Sync time="222.42"/>
erm | we have er the machine that has pipes into the ceiling
<Sync time="227.39"/>

<Sync time="228.44"/>
with the blue barrel in front of it
<Sync time="230.27"/>

<Sync time="231.78"/>
and some red | it's like tool boxes next to it
<Sync time="235.79"/>

<Sync time="238.66"/>
erm there's also an separate | desk area with | some tools on top of it like a microscope and things like that
<Sync time="245.56"/>

<Sync time="246.26"/>
and it's got some
<Sync time="247.92"/>

<Sync time="248.22"/>
er boxes underneath it
<Sync time="250.2"/>

<Sync time="251.14"/>
in the middle of the room there's er | two stations facing each other
<Sync time="255.3"/>

<Sync time="255.74"/>
so one of them's got | g_ clamps on the side of it
<Sync time="259.19"/>

<Sync time="259.9"/>
and the other one | looks like | you'd er | cut things against it to keep it straight
<Sync time="265.4"/>

<Sync time="265.87"/>
so wood workshop stuff
<Sync time="268.23"/>

<Sync time="270.63"/>
er the other side the room
<Sync time="272.86"/>

<Sync time="273.94"/>
there's looks like a laser cutter | erm it's like a | a machine with shelves below it and on top it's got some sort of
<Sync time="282.04"/>

<Sync time="282.19"/>
oh no it's one of those drills that comes down from above
<Sync time="284.64"/>

<Sync time="285.94"/>
and it's got a_ fan thing next to it
<Sync time="288.9"/>

<Sync time="290.86"/>
there's also a fire extinguisher in the corner
<Sync time="293.22"/>

<Sync time="293.78"/>
and a weird triangular shaped cabinet
<Sync time="296.53"/>

<Sync time="300.66"/>
I think that's everything
<Sync time="302.26"/>

<Sync time="303.07"/>
so there's two doors going through the new door
<Sync time="305.92"/>

<Sync time="306.26"/>
into a_ bedroom
<Sync time="307.94"/>

<Sync time="309.21"/>
which has a big double bed
<Sync time="310.99"/>

<Sync time="311.13"/>
with
<Sync time="312.4"/>

<Sync time="312.82"/>
eight posters above it or photos above it
<Sync time="315.74"/>

<Sync time="316.19"/>
two bedside tables one of them has a phone
<Sync time="318.92"/>

<Sync time="319.57"/>
and they both have lamps on the wall
<Sync time="322.13"/>

<Sync time="324.15"/>
there's also a hoover
<Sync time="325.93"/>

<Sync time="328.12"/>
a radiator
<Sync time="329.62"/>

<Sync time="330.24"/>
and a massive wardrobe with clothes in it
<Sync time="333.4"/>

<Sync time="335.92"/>
er that's two doors in total so we're going into the new room
<Sync time="339.17"/>

<Sync time="339.31"/>
which is back into the living room with the piano
<Sync time="342.07"/>

<Sync time="343.03"/>
so are there any spare doors
<Sync time="344.75"/>

<Sync time="357.3"/>
er that comes back into the study | so there's just three doors in total
<Sync time="361.38"/>

<Sync time="372.86"/>
okay erm
<Sync time="374.67"/>

<Sync time="375.19"/>
so living room | piano | the stool a rug ceiling fan
<Sync time="380.72"/>

<Sync time="381.2"/>
a record player
<Sync time="382.82"/>

<Sync time="383.08"/>
it's got
<Sync time="384.47"/>

<Sync time="384.66"/>
two sofas which are green
<Sync time="386.8"/>

<Sync time="386.96"/>
a grandfather clock and two more | green chairs | which are like soft chairs but I wouldn't call the armchairs
<Sync time="395.09"/>

<Sync time="396.8"/>
so if I go through to
<Sync time="398.97"/>

<Sync time="401.31"/>
where the fire was i'll just check I didn't leave anyone dying in there
<Sync time="404.37"/>

<Sync time="406.64"/>
no | so in the workshop
<Sync time="409.17"/>

<Sync time="412.52"/>
erm | we got a_ | fire extinguisher | triangular cabinet
<Sync time="417.94"/>

<Sync time="418.76"/>
we got two workstations in the centre
<Sync time="421.42"/>

<Sync time="421.82"/>
erm
<Sync time="423.05"/>

<Sync time="423.17"/>
for | wood cutting
<Sync time="425.58"/>

<Sync time="426.24"/>
there's another | station with shelves attached and | er microscopes and things on top
<Sync time="432.62"/>

<Sync time="434.14"/>
er there's a_ red well sort two red tool boxes on top of each other
<Sync time="439.45"/>

<Sync time="440.11"/>
um
<Sync time="441.33"/>

<Sync time="441.48"/>
the thing which I can't remember what it is but it has the tubes into the ceiling
<Sync time="444.5"/>

<Sync time="445.35"/>
and that's right next to fire
<Sync time="447.07"/>

<Sync time="447.39"/>
there's a blue barrel
<Sync time="448.7"/>

<Sync time="449.6"/>
er in the fire there's
<Sync time="451.62"/>

<Sync time="453.15"/>
some shelves with | looks like tools on them that are in flames
<Sync time="457.99"/>

<Sync time="460.73"/>
and there's | also a cabinet above that
<Sync time="464.38"/>

<Sync time="465.46"/>
and there's one I didn't mention which is er a green
<Sync time="468.42"/>

<Sync time="469.07"/>
some sort of tool below that which is like a
<Sync time="471.93"/>

<Sync time="472.722"/>
something you cut wood against or something like that 
<Sync time="475.338"/>
