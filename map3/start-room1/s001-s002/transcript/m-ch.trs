and then yeah that room has
<Sync time="664.362"/>
three doors
<Sync time="665.763"/>

<Sync time="666.93"/>
just seeing if there's anything else in the other rooms
<Sync time="669.46"/>

<Sync time="672.0"/>
erm | so if I go through from the green sitting room
<Sync time="676.1"/>

<Sync time="676.67"/>
erm into the kitchen
<Sync time="678.78"/>

<Sync time="679.150"/>
just in the kitchen there are two fridges
<Sync time="681.57"/>

<Sync time="681.87"/>
like a little | kitchen bit in the corner with like a sink and an over
<Sync time="686.46"/>

<Sync time="687.136"/>
and then like a big dining table in the middle
<Sync time="690.452"/>

<Sync time="691.571"/>
and | an oven another oven on the side
<Sync time="695.13"/>

<Sync time="695.909"/>
yeah
<Sync time="696.947"/>

<Sync time="699.05"/>
and then if I go so that | that kitchen has two doors
<Sync time="702.39"/>

<Sync time="703.46"/>
and then if I go through the second door of the kitchen
<Sync time="705.947"/>

<Sync time="706.13"/>
that's the workshop that's on fire
<Sync time="708.712"/>

<Sync time="709.439"/>
and then in there it's just | there's not really much in there just like
<Sync time="713.773"/>

<Sync time="714.17"/>
it looks like a tech room | just loads of like wood
<Sync time="717.48"/>

<Sync time="717.968"/>
like wooden work | surfaces
<Sync time="720.47"/>

<Sync time="722.11"/>
and then if I go through there
<Sync time="724.086"/>
