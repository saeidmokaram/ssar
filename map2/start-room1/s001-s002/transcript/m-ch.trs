<Sync time="279.49"/>

<Sync time="279.57"/>
i'll just | right i'll go from where I came from | so I started off in that children's bedroom
<Sync time="285.77"/>

<Sync time="287.43"/>
and then | [let] [me] [just] [do] [it's] [turn]
<Sync time="290.518"/>

<Sync time="290.74"/>
yep so I started off in there
<Sync time="293.22"/>

<Sync time="294.49"/>
which had only one door through to the living room
<Sync time="297.61"/>

<Sync time="298.92"/>
and then when I got into the living room | there was a door
<Sync time="302.25"/>

<Sync time="302.35"/>
other than the one I just came from on the left | straight ahead and on the right
<Sync time="306.96"/>

<Sync time="308.1"/>
and the one on the left if you go through | is l- | yeah the library
<Sync time="312.87"/>

<Sync time="312.97"/>
with no other
<Sync time="314.56"/>

<Sync time="314.76"/>
erm | broom just on it's own
<Sync time="317.86"/>

<Sync time="318.1"/>
and then the second door
<Sync time="319.82"/>

<Sync time="319.88"/>

<Sync time="333.74"/>

<Sync time="335.56"/>
the
<Sync time="336.92"/>

<Sync time="338.525"/>
bedroom that's not on fire
<Sync time="340.21"/>

<Sync time="341.79"/>
$ @ and then the third room is
